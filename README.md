# Bash Scripts for Ubuntu Application Setup

## Project Description
This repository contains a set of Bash scripts created to automate the installation and setup of commonly used software on Ubuntu systems.  
The scripts help reduce manual effort when installing Java, Apache, Tomcat, and Nginx.

The objective of this project is to make application installation faster, consistent, and easy to repeat across Ubuntu environments.

## Overview
Manually installing applications on Linux servers can be time-consuming and error-prone.  
These scripts provide a simple command-line based approach to install and configure essential services, making them useful for learning, testing, and basic server automation.

Before running the scripts, make sure you have:

1. Basic knowledge of Linux commands  
2. An Ubuntu-based operating system  
3. Sudo/root access
