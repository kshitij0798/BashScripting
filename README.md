# Bash Scripts for Ubuntu Application Setup

## Project Description
This repository contains a collection of Bash scripts designed to automate the installation and setup of commonly used software on Ubuntu systems.
The scripts help simplify system configuration by reducing manual steps involved in installing Java, Apache, Tomcat, and Nginx.

The goal of this project is to make application installation faster, repeatable, and reliable on Ubuntu-based environments.
