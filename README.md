# Bash Scripts for Ubuntu Application Setup

## Project Description
This repository contains a set of Bash scripts created to automate the installation and setup of commonly used software on Ubuntu systems.  
The scripts help reduce manual effort when installing Java, Apache, Tomcat, and Nginx.

The objective of this project is to make application installation faster, consistent, and easy to repeat across Ubuntu environments.
